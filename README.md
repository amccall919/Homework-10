# Homework-10

For this challenge, I used SQLAlchemy to do a climate analysis on Honolulu, HI where I will be taking a vacation...I wish! The main focus of the analysis was on precipitation and temperature. Through this analysis, I was able to determine the amounts of rain within one year of the date that I would be going on this vacation. Through the table created with this infromation, I was able to see that a point between the dates of 08/23/16 and 11/09/16 had the highest rainfall. Based on that, I may want to take my vacation in January or February as those months seemed to have the least amount of rain. And through the analysis to find temperatures, I was able to use the station IDs to determine the minimum, maximum and average temps around the island. In doing so, I was able to see that the minimum temperature has been 54 degrees, the maximum has been 85 degrees and the average temp for Honolulu is 71.7 degrees. This was a very fun exercise and one that I might actually use to plan my next vacation!
